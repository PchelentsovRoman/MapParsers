# MapParsers
### Make sure you are in the root folder of the project<br>
#### Install the package installer PIP for Python:
```
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/
```
#### Use the requirements.txt file to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### To run the kfc site parser, use the "kfcParser.py" file.
#### Data file will be stored in data_file_kfc.json

#### To run the ZIKO website parser, use the "zikoParser.py" file.
#### Data file will be stored in data_file_ziko.json
#### To run the Monomax site parser, use the "monomaxParser.py" file. 
#### Data file will be stored in data_file_monomax.json
##### In Monomax, due to js parsing, the code came out very unreliable. Sorry it's so late, I just saw your post in the mail last night.
