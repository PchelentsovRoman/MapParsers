# MapParsers
### Make sure you are in the root folder of the project<br>
#### Install the package installer PIP for Python.
***
### https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

### To run the kfc site parser, use the "kfcParser.py" file.

### To run the ZIKO website parser, use the "zikoParser.py" file.
### To run the Monomax site parser, use the "monomaxParser.py" file. In Monomax, due to js parsing, the code came out very unreliable. Sorry it's so late, I just saw ### your post in the mail last night.
